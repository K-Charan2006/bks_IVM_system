# bks_IVM_system
This repository showcases the design of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, including the system architecture and user flow for call routing, DTMF/voice input handling, and automated responses.
📌 Overview

An IVR system allows users to interact with a phone system through voice commands or keypad (DTMF) inputs. This repo provides the high-level design and workflow for implementing an efficient IVR solution.

🏗️ Architecture

Telephony Layer – Handles inbound/outbound calls.

IVR Engine – Processes call flows, menus, and user input.

Application Server – Business logic, API integrations, CRM/Database.

Database – Stores user data, call logs, and preferences.

Response System – Provides automated replies via TTS (Text-to-Speech) or pre-recorded messages.

🔄 User Flow

User calls the IVR number.

IVR greets and presents menu options.

User selects via DTMF input or voice command.

IVR routes the request to the correct department/service.

Automated response or agent handover occurs.

Call ends or loops back to menu.

🚀 Use Cases

Customer Support Automation

Appointment Scheduling

Feedback & Surveys

Emergency Helplines

⚙️ Tech Stack (Example)

Asterisk / Twilio – Telephony integration

Flask / Node.js – Backend logic

MySQL / MongoDB – Data storage

Google Speech / AWS Polly – Speech recognition & TTS
